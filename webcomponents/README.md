WebComponents example
=============
What is WebComponents?
--
Web Components consists of several separate technologies. You can think of Web Components as reusable user interface widgets that are created using open Web technology. They are part of the browser, and so they do not need external libraries like jQuery or Dojo. An existing Web Component can be used without writing code, simply by adding an import statement to an HTML page. Web Components use new or still-developing standard browser capabilities.

Web Components consists of these four technologies (although each can be used separately):
<ul>
<li> Custom Elements </li>
<li> HTML Templates </li>
<li> Shadow DOM </li>
<li> HTML Imports </li>
</ul>
