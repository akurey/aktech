> HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

First of all, you need to install node to run the example.

When you have node installed, go in your Terminal to App folder and type `node app.js` to run the web server.
